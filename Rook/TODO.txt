// BUG: test to make sure that people can't lay on the very first round out of turn

// BUG: when there's already a game going, another set of people can't get past the confirmation page... javascript errors saying "thisGame is undefined"

// BUG: If trump is led, another player who lays the rook while having other trump gets "Sorry, you must follow suit" alert.

BUG: first card laid dissappears if it's laid before the other cards have finished animating off the screen - it's because it
	blindly deletes all cards with "played" attribute.
